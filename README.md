## Home Energy Usage Dashboard

*Sadly, my EGauge device was fried by a lightning strike, so this dashboard is no longer operational.*

This dashboard interacts with my home's EGauge energy monitoring device, showing energy usage and solar power generation.  It estimates the Austin Energy bill for the selected time period using Austin Energy's tiered rate structure.

I made this dashboard during a Full Stack Development course with Austin Coding Academy.

## Built With

* Node.js
* Express
